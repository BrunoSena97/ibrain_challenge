        Incorporate feedback from the Software Engineer to ensure the design is feasible and aligned with the technical requirements.
    User Testing (Optional):
        If possible, conduct simple user testing with friends or family to get feedback on the initial designs.
        Observe how users interact with the mockups and gather insights on what works and what doesn't.

Day 3: Closure:

    Refining Designs:
        Based on feedback and testing, refine the mockups and wireframes to improve the user experience.
