Day 1: Launch & Ideation:

    SWOT Analysis: A SWOT analysis helps identify the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to their product idea. This is a great starting point to understand the market landscape and potential challenges.
    Preliminary Market Research: Encourage the BA to start exploring the target market:
        Who are the potential customers?
        What problem does the product solve for them?
        How big is the market? Are there similar products out there?

Day 2: Build-Measure-Learn:

    Business Model Canvas (BMC): This is a visual tool that helps map out the key components of a business, such as customer segments, value proposition, revenue streams, and key resources. This can help the BA understand how the product will create value and generate revenue.
    Competitor Analysis: Identify direct and indirect competitors.
        How does the product compare to existing solutions?
        What are the strengths and weaknesses of the competition?

Day 3: Closure:

    Business Plan Outline: Based on the insights gained from the SWOT analysis, BMC, and competitor analysis, the BA can start drafting a basic business plan outline. This doesn't have to be a full-fledged plan, but rather a summary of the key points:
        Problem: The problem the product solves.
        Solution: How the product addresses the problem.
        Target Market: Who the product is for.
        Value Proposition: What makes the product unique and valuable.
        Marketing and Sales Strategy: How to reach and sell to customers.
        Financial Projections: Estimated costs and potential revenue.

Additional Tips:

    Keep it Simple: For a short internship, focus on the core elements of a business plan. The BA can always elaborate on it later.
    Collaboration is Key: Encourage the BA to share their findings with the rest of the team and get their input.
    Iterative Process: The business plan should evolve as the team learns more about the market and the product.
    Presentation: On the final day, the BA should be prepared to present their findings and business plan outline to the rest of the team and you as the Product Owner.
